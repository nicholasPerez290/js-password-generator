# js-password-generator

# Purpose

- The purpose of this program is to generate a random password based on user inputs of:

- length of the password

- Do you want uppercase letters

- Do you want lowercase letter

- Do you want numbers

- Do you want special characters

# How it works

- The user is prompted to select a length and is checked to see if the value is between 8-128.

- If it is not the user is alerted and then prompted again.

- The user selects witch type of characters they want.

- The password is generated.

- The user can start again by pressing the red button.

- The program uses Javascript to compile an array based on your criteria.

- It then uses for loops and math.random() to generate a new array of random characters from the larger array.

- I then used join('') to convert that last array to a string and generate your password.
